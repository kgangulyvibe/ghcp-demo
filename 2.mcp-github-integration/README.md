- User and organization information

## Configuration in VS Code

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code**: Version 1.85 or later
2. **GitHub Copilot Extension**: Latest version
3. **Node.js**: Version 18 or later
4. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: With appropriate permissions

### Step 1: Install Required Extensions

```bash
# Install GitHub Copilot if not already installed
code --install-extension GitHub.copilot

# Install GitHub Copilot Chat (if available)
code --install-extension GitHub.copilot-chat
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub MCP Server

1. **Create MCP Configuration File**

Create a file at `~/.config/mcp/github-mcp.json` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\mcp\github-mcp.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Generate GitHub Personal Access Token**

Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic):

Required permissions:
- `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- `read:org` (Read org and team membership)
- `read:user` (Read user profile data)
- `read:project` (Read project metadata)

3. **Update VS Code Settings**

Add to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": true,
    "plaintext": true,
    "markdown": true
  },
  "mcp.servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Install GitHub MCP Server

```bash
# Install the GitHub MCP Server globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github

# Or install locally in your project
npm install @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github
```

### Step 4: Restart VS Code

Restart VS Code to apply the configuration changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "GitHub MCP Server not found"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall the MCP server
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github

# Verify installation
which npx
npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github --version
```

#### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**:
1. Verify your GitHub token is correct
2. Check token permissions include required scopes
3. Test token manually:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

#### Issue: "Slow response times"
**Solution**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify GitHub API rate limits:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```
3. Consider using a more specific token with minimal required permissions

#### Issue: "Copilot not using GitHub context"
**Solution**:
1. Restart VS Code
2. Check VS Code Developer Console for errors
3. Verify MCP configuration in settings.json
4. Test with explicit repository references
